# Synchronization coverage and ownership matrix

Generated from `database/sqlserver/schema-registry.json` (67 synchronized tables). Do not edit by hand; run `npm run audit:sync`.

Electron operational reads and writes use local SQL Server. Supabase is the online synchronization peer. SQL Server Change Tracking detects ordinary row changes; `sync_change_journal` groups complete business transactions. No renderer/device outbox is used by Electron.

## Local-only SQL Server infrastructure

- `schema_migrations`: local database operation/synchronization metadata; never uploaded as a business table.
- `sync_checkpoints`: local database operation/synchronization metadata; never uploaded as a business table.
- `sync_change_journal`: local database operation/synchronization metadata; never uploaded as a business table.
- `sync_conflicts`: local database operation/synchronization metadata; never uploaded as a business table.
- `database_jobs`: local database operation/synchronization metadata; never uploaded as a business table.
- `local_operation_receipts`: local database operation/synchronization metadata; never uploaded as a business table.

## Cloud-only synchronization infrastructure

- `sync_change_feed`: server-side feed/idempotency infrastructure; never treated as POS operational data.
- `sync_idempotency_receipts`: server-side feed/idempotency infrastructure; never treated as POS operational data.

## Verification meaning

- `SYNCED`: incremental push/pull completed and branch-scoped counts match.
- `VERIFIED`: a full branch-scoped data signature also matches. A count match alone is never labelled verified.
- `DIFFERENT`: count or signature differs; targeted repair is required.
