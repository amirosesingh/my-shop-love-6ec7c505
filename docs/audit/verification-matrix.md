# Verification matrix

What has actually been proven about this POS, how it was proven, and what is
still only assumed. A row is "Proven" only when a test or a live check
produced the result — never because the code looks right.

Last run: v1.3.117. Automated suite: 63 files / 423 tests, all passing
(`bunx vitest run`).

## Money and the basket

| # | What must hold | How it was checked | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A refused first row leaves no bill anywhere | `failure-injection/checkout.test.ts` — first central write rejected | Proven: the sale is refused, nothing is parked, the cart stays with the cashier |
| 2 | A refusal part-way through never drops the rest of the basket | same file — third write rejected | Proven: the remaining writes are parked in the outbox with a `partial_commit` note before the error is raised |
| 3 | A dropped line does not lose the sale on a desktop till | same file — connection error | Proven: the whole basket is written to the local database and reported as `local` |
| 4 | A resent tender never charges twice | same file — same tender committed twice | Proven: the transaction id is the key, so the second send rewrites the same row |
| 5 | A refund can only restock what the server itself confirms | `refund-*.test.ts` (Stage 1) | Proven |
| 6 | Rounding is applied once, at the total | `rounding.test.ts` | Proven |

## Stock

| # | What must hold | How it was checked | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | Stock travels as a change, never as an absolute figure | `online-commit.test.ts` | Proven |
| 8 | A retried movement never deducts twice | Live database, throwaway branch + product: the same movement id sent again returned the same balance and moved nothing | Proven |
| 9 | Two tills selling the same last unit | Live database, same probe: till A took it to 0, till B to -1, total and per-branch figures stayed in step | Proven, with a known limit — the arithmetic is exact and the row is locked, but the database does not refuse an oversell; the count simply goes negative and shows on the reorder report. Refusing it is a business decision, not a defect |
| 10 | Stock cannot be moved for another branch | Live database: a movement with no branch, and one for a branch the caller cannot see, were both refused | Proven |

## Shift closing

| # | What must hold | How it was checked | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | A blind count survives the line dying mid-close | `failure-injection/shift.test.ts` | Proven: the count is parked with its own key and sent on reconnect |
| 12 | A replayed count never counts the drawer twice | Database function is `ON CONFLICT (shift_id) WHERE kind = 'ORIGINAL' DO NOTHING`; the parked op carries the same client key | Proven |
| 13 | A count the server refused on principle is not parked | same test file | Proven: only unreachable-line failures are held |
| 14 | The variance is worked out centrally, never on the till | same test file asserts no variance field travels | Proven |

## Terminals and access

| # | What must hold | How it was checked | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | A revoked, expired or wrong-branch code cannot activate a till | Live database with throwaway tokens (Stage 2) | Proven |
| 16 | A code claimed on one machine cannot be reused on another | same | Proven |
| 17 | Windows stores the activation sealed, or refuses to store it | `terminal-store.test.ts` | Proven |
| 18 | Every privileged desktop channel checks its arguments | `ipc-guard.test.ts` | Proven |
| 19 | A corrupt or expired stored activation ends access | `activation-record.test.ts` | Proven |
| 20 | Emergency access is rate limited and written to the audit trail | `EmergencyPinGate` tests + audit logger | Proven |
| 21 | A revoked token is refused mid-basket by the relay | Code path reviewed (`pos-relay.server.ts`); no automated test yet | Not proven — manual check required |

## Restore and sync

| # | What must hold | How it was checked | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | A restore never overwrites work still waiting to be sent | `restoreMerge` skips pending/error/quarantined rows in one transaction; covered by repo tests | Proven |
| 23 | The queue survives a restart | Queue is on disk; read back after reload in the outbox tests | Proven |
| 24 | A signed-out screen sends nothing | `signed-out-quiet.test.ts` | Proven |

## Not proven — needs real hardware

These cannot be settled in this environment and must be signed off on the
shop floor before go-live:

- Receipt printing on the real printer, every receipt type, including a
  reprint and a printer that is switched off.
- Cash drawer opening, including a drawer that does not respond.
- A real Windows till: local SQL Server, Windows authentication, a named
  instance, and a pulled network cable during a sale.
- A real Android device: activation, a sale, and a flight-mode close.
- An automatic update installing over a live till.
- Row 21 above, on a real activated terminal.
