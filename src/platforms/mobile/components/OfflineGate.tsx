/**
 * Connection gate for the browser and Android builds.
 *
 * Neither holds business data, so every screen needs the backend. Nothing is
 * ever declared offline on a guess: while the first heartbeat is still in
 * flight the app shows only the pulsing cloud icon — no logo, no toast, no
 * error — and it keeps showing it for as long as the check takes. The Windows
 * till never renders the gate: `isOnlineOnly()` is false there.
