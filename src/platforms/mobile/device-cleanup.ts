/**
 * Phone storage hygiene.
 *
 * Android keeps only what a terminal genuinely needs — activation, device key,
 * backend address, cloud keys, a couple of interface preferences and the open
 * ticket. Everything else is cache: downloaded APK files left in the external
 * cache after an update, and WebView scratch. Those are cleared on every
 * launch, and the whole cache is dropped on the first launch after the shell
 * version changes so a new build never runs against old assets.
 *
 * Uninstall leaves nothing because Android removes the app's private storage
 * and the manifest now forbids Auto Backup (see scripts/android-permissions.cjs),
 * so a reinstall can no longer be restored from Google's cloud.
