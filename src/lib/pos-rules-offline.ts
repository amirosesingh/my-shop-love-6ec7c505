/**
 * Saving register rules when the central system cannot be reached.
 *
 * A rule change is stored on the till first — through the same gateway every
 * other change uses, so the background sync worker uploads it, retries on its
 * own and only clears it once the central database has confirmed it. The till
 * applies the change immediately, and keeps applying it after a restart,
 * because the pending set is written to the encrypted device store as well.
 *
 * Nothing here decides who may change a rule: the screen has already checked
 * that, and the central save re-checks it on the server when the change is
 * uploaded.
