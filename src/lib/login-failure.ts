/**
 * Why a sign-in did not go through — in categories, not raw backend text.
 *
 * A till that has not been connected to a company yet, a company database that
 * cannot be reached and a mistyped password are three completely different
 * problems, and only one of them is about the password. Before this module the
 * screen printed whatever the cloud replied, so every one of them read as
 * "Invalid login credentials" and sent people looking for the wrong fix.
 *
 * Nothing here ever carries a key, a token, a password or a server detail: the
 * category and a short sentence are all that leave this file.
