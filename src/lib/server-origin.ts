/**
 * Where this build should send app-server calls.
 *
 * The Android APK serves the whole app from a local origin inside the phone,
 * so a relative request to `/api/...` never reaches a real server — the local
 * static server answers with the app shell instead. The Windows till has the
 * same problem in reverse: its bundled local server used to answer privileged
 * calls itself, which meant keeping a privileged key on a shop counter.
 *
 * Both therefore send app-server calls to the hosted backend, whose address
 * is configured per device and applied at runtime by `backend-config.ts`.
 * There is deliberately NO build-time fallback: the same APK and installer
 * are sold to different customers, so an address baked in at build time would
 * point one customer's till at another customer's server. When the device has
 * nothing saved the address stays empty and the setup screen asks for it.
 * Web keeps using relative URLs.
