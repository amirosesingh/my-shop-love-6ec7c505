/**
 * One answer to "is this device configured?" for Android and Windows.
 *
 * A shipped APK or installer carries no customer: no project URL, no key, no
 * backend address. Everything comes from the device's own secure store — the
 * Electron OS vault or the Android Keystore — written by the setup screen
 * through `saveConnectionProfile()`. Until that exists the terminal is simply
 * UNCONFIGURED, which is a normal state, not an error: the app opens setup
 * instead of touching a backend.
 *
 * Nothing here reads web environment values, and nothing here goes to the
 * network. It is a pure local readiness check that every backend-dependent
 * start-up step consults first.
